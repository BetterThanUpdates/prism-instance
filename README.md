# How it works

The link above is a shortcut to the `Download ZIP`
option found under the green arrow button at the top of this page.

Prism supports downloading modpacks from URLs.
And it's smart enough to know that the folder inside the ZIP file contains the modpack.
So Prism handles the entire installation process by itself.
